It was an amazing experience and I would definitely go again. I was nervous at
first but once we got on the plane I couldn't wait to be in free fall. The
Dropouts' discount really helped and it was great to go with friends from Miami.

At first I thought that there would be fear, but as I looked down from the edge
of the plane and tumbled down into the open sky, I could only feel one strange
sensation: Peace. Even plummeting toward the Earth, wind whipping my hair and
clothes, it was one of the only times in my life when I had felt so alive. It
was an incredible experience, and I can't wait to jump again.

In the morning, you will complete a first-jump course outlining the safe and

allows, in the afternoon you will complete your first skydive! A line will be
attached to the inside of the plane, with the other end attached to your
parachute. As soon as you exit the plane your parachute will open on its own due
to the line. You won't have very much freefall time, but you will spend the next
5 minutes flying your parachute to the ground solo. A radio will be provided so
that a certified USPA coach can talk you to the ground safely. This is the ideal

instructors will hold onto your jumpsuit for the duration of the freefall to
keep you stable, but you will deploy and pilot your own parachute. You will
freefall for approximately 45 seconds with your instructors. If you want the
most thrilling and challenging option available, schedule an AFF jump today!
